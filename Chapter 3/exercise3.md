# Instructions  

The material for this lesson is based on [Chapter 3: Hello, little turtles](https://learnpythontherightway.com/chapter/chapter-3.html).

For this lesson, you will be required to complete the  exercises below. 

Make sure to write your solutions in the `main.py` file.


2. Give three attributes of your cellphone object. Give three methods of your cellphone.


3. Write a program that uses a `for` loop to print

    ```python
    One of the months of the year is January
    One of the months of the year is February
    ...
    ```

4. Suppose our turtle tess is at heading `0` — facing east. We execute the statement `tess.left(3645)`. What does tess do, and what is her final heading?


5. Assume you have the assignment `xs = [12, 10, 32, 3, 66, 17, 42, 99, 20]`

  a. Write a loop that prints each of the numbers on a new line.
 
  b. Write a loop that prints each number and its square on a new line.
  c. Write a loop that adds all the numbers from the list into a variable called `total`. You should set the `total` variable to have the value `0` before you start adding them up, and print the value in total after the loop has completed.
  
  d. Print the product of all the numbers in the list. (product means all multiplied together)


6. Use `for` loops to make a turtle draw these regular polygons (regular means all sides the same lengths, all angles the same):
   - An equilateral triangle
   - A square
   - A hexagon (six sides)
   - An octagon (eight sides)


11. Write a program to draw a shape like this:

Hints:

-  Try this on a piece of paper, moving and turning your cellphone as if it was a turtle. Watch how many complete rotations your cellphone makes before you complete the star. Since each full rotation is 360 degrees, you can figure out the total number of degrees that your phone was rotated through. If you divide that by 5, because there are five points to the star, you’ll know how many degrees to turn the turtle at each point.


- You can hide a turtle behind its invisibility cloak if you don’t want it shown. It will still draw its lines if its pen is down. The method is invoked as `tess.hideturtle()`. To make the turtle visible again, use `tess.showturtle()`.

12. Write a program to draw a face of a clock that looks something like this:

![Clock face](assets/clock_face.png)

13. Create a turtle, and assign it to a variable. When you ask for its type, what do you get?


14. What is the collective noun for turtles? (Hint: they don’t come in _herds_.)


15. What the collective noun for pythons? Is a python a viper? Is a python venomous?
