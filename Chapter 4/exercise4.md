# Instructions  

The material for this lesson is based on [Chapter 4: Functions](https://learnpythontherightway.com/chapter/chapter-4.html).

For this lesson, you will be required to complete the  exercises below. 

Make sure to write your solutions in the `main.py` file.

1. Write a void (non-fruitful) function to draw a square. Use it in a program to draw the image shown below. Assume each side is 20 units. (*Hint: notice that the turtle has already moved away from the ending point of the last square when the program ends.*)

3. Write a void function `draw_poly(t, n, sz)` which makes a turtle draw a regular polygon. When called with `draw_poly(tess, 8, 50)`, it will draw a shape like this:

5. The two spirals in this picture differ only by the turn angle. Draw both.

7. Write a fruitful function `sum_to(n)` that returns the sum of all integer numbers up to and including `n`. So `sum_to(10)` would be `1+2+3…+10` which would return the value `55`.


8. Write a function `area_of_circle(r)` which returns the area of a circle of radius `r`.
