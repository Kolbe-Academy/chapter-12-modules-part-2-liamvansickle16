# Instructions  

The material for this lesson is based on [Chapter 19: Exceptions](https://learnpythontherightway.com/chapter/chapter-19.html).

For this lesson, you will be required to complete the exercises below. 

Make sure to write your solutions in the `main.py` file.

1.  Write a function named `readposint` that uses the `input` dialog to prompt the user for a positive integer and then checks the input to confirm that it meets the requirements. It should be able to handle inputs that cannot be converted to `int`, as well as negative `int`s, and edge cases (e.g. when the user closes the dialog, or does not enter anything at all.)
